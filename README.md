# ActuarialStochAnalysis
Learning how to create an predictive model on stocks and portfolios to obtain the highest probability of profit based on quantitive models and actuarial capital modelling aspects

I managed to map out the whole portfolios returns of which in this case MFC, BANC, BYFC and PROV stock are used

Also getting poast correlation between stocks

And the most important part being the distribution of returns of which shows a high chance of not making a not so good profit!

I also created a function in which used the RSI and Double Exponential Moving Average with period 10
to obtain below.
